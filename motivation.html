                <p class="citation__motivation__text"> "I want to, but I can't", "I lack motivation", "I couldn't do it this Monday, I'll try next Monday"... Perhaps there is no person who would have started exercising and not faced with the fact that the couch has become unusually soft, and social networks - amazingly interesting. Let's figure out how to find motivation, whether you can pump up your willpower, and what to do to avoid blending in with regular workouts. </p>

                <h2 class="intro__motivation__title"> Problem #1: Lack of motivation </h2>
                <img src="img/motivation.jpg" alt="" class="motivation__img">
                <p class="motivation__text"> Let's start with a word that for many has already become synonymous with the word "sport. Motivation. Motivation this and motivation that. I don't have motivation, so I'm a hardened slacker. Or maybe I initially have it, but then it evaporates, like a cake out of the fridge at night. Why? Motivation is always based on a desire or urge to act. In terms of sports, it is most often played by the hackneyed and beloved "I want to lose weight. In fact, this message is false. The desire to lose weight - not an end in itself. If it is, it is worth asking yourself, "To do what? "Losing weight is much easier than dealing with what's going on in your life, with what's wrong with it, easier than taking risks and changing things, easier than dealing with your own feelings." </p>
                <h2 class="intro__motivation__title"> Problem #2: Lack of willpower </h2>
                <img src="img/discipline.jpg" alt="" class="motivation__img">
                <p class="motivation__text"> First of all, scientists are increasingly saying that willpower does not exist at all. Secondly, it is a mistake to exercise by overcoming yourself. You can grit your teeth as much as you like, but the result will lead to the opposite consequences: after a while you will hate training so much that you will bypass all gyms three kilometers away for the rest of your life. Here works a very simple, obvious, but only one piece of advice: turn sports into fun. Is it realistic? Absolutely. Fitness is not limited to one direction, it is necessary to include several different sports. In addition, the types of workouts can be combined depending on your current mood, physical condition or Mercury retrograde (no). </p>
                <h2 class="intro__motivation__title"> Problem #3: Lack of performance </h2>
                <img src="img/results.jpg" alt="" class="motivation__img">
                <p class="motivation__text"> When you come to one group, everyone is already on the splits. In another group, they're all taking maximum weight. In the third group, they're doing dances worthy of a TV show. And you decide that since you can't show such results right away, it's better not to start at all. "Attitudes of this type are called black and white thinking in cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. In other words, a maximalist "all or nothing" attitude. How to fight it? "Don't berate yourself for the fact that the result is not as fast as you would like it to be. Such self-criticism demotivates, - And do not compare yourself with others - all people are unique: some are better at one thing, someone else. It's also important to celebrate your achievements - they are bound to show up after a while! Now you've already picked up dumbbells one kilogram heavier, now you increased the pace of running, now you managed to curl up in the correct asana. Do not be hard on yourself, because sport is first of all pleasure, endorphins from the spent energy, a way of spending time and taking care of your body, but not a race for the perfect abs. However, when you get into it, the abs can appear by themselves ;) </p>
